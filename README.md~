This Project is on Anomaly detection in multiple time-series. Given more than one time-series 
with dependency on each other we try to find anomaly in time-series.

This project is developed by Kapil Thakkar and Reshma Kumari, IIT Delhi. (CSE M. Tech. 2014-2016),
under the guidance of Dr. Aaditeshwar Seth
