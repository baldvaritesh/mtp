Confusion Matrix for Mumbai


Going methods-wise:
1. Slope Based    
2. Correlation based
3. Linear Regression
4. Graph based
5. Multivariate
6. 1 U 2 U 3
7. 4 U 5
8. 6 ^ 7


What we have to do is find out what results were not reported in news and still reported by method and why news were present and not reported by method.

So i will start with center Mumbai and method I choose is Slope Based.

Retail vs Average:
    
    Anomalies reported : 742
    News Articles Present for Center: 143
    News Articles Matched: 53
    If we consider anomalies reported from 2010: 471
    
    Since articles are present from 2010 only, we will focus on analysis of 2010 onwards...
    
    Anomalies reported in January, 2010 by his method, has more drop in original retail prices than original. Actually, this is good thing for center Mumbai and not good for other centers contributing to average, as prices over there are more as compared to Mumbai. This is limitation of this method, that this method just reports abnormaly high or low slope values. In this case it is good for center but since slope value is high, it is reported as anomaly.
    
    Anomalies reported in (Jun 2010, August 2010, May 2011, June 2011, Nov 2012, Apr 2013) are such that original prices are increasing more as compared to average retail price. So, anomalies reported are normal.
    
    Dec 2010, (Jan Feb 2012), June 2013 could not be captured by this method, because along with center Mumbai, in other centers as well, prices went high. So no abnormal values of slopes were observed.
    
    Article : 2011-09-20 : contains keyword delete, still reported in query.
    
    Oct and Nov 2011, Feb 2012, Mar 2012, Dec 2014, March 2015 original prices were less as compared to average, but average was high from start only. And there was sudden hike in original price. So this should have been reported and it is normal.
    
    In May and Jun 2012, original prices went high suddenly as compared to average. So, it is quite normal.
    Also, in Jun 2012, Aug 2012, Jan 2013, Feb 2014, Oct 2014, Feb 2015 prices also went down. But it went down more in Mumbai, as compared to average. So, slope value is high. This is another reason for false positives in this method. 
    
    
    Dec 27, 2012 article was not reported by our system, but one week before that Dec 22, 2012 was reported as anomaly by this method. So, delay in coming this thing as news can be considered as a reason for why our system did not match that.
    
    In May 2013, prices went too much high as compared to average. Very Very High.
    
    We have many news around Aug 2013, Sept Oct Nov 2013 and our system has reported one tenure in this month. News is spread out for whole this month and that's why some of the news articles are missed. Note that prices went too much high. 
    
    March end to May start 2014 is reported as anomaly. We have few articles matched in this tenure. Since, prices were abnormal for large tenure, news articles could not be present for so long tenure. This might be reason why we have few articles matched.
    
    For Jun 2014, we have reported tenure upto mid june when prices started in creasing, but it remained high and due to that some articles are present for Jun 21 around, which we have missed.
    
    In Aug Sept 2014, there were too many up downs and that's why that tenure is reported. Why no news present, we can't comment.
    
    May, Jun 2015 article is not reported because retail and average were going hand in hand. Prices went high, yes, but at all centers. Even news articles says that.
    
    Also, note one thing that, this method reports anomaly as whole window. So, because of that too, we have more anomaly dates.
    
Retail vs Wholesale:    
    
    Drop in retail was more as compared to wholesale
        In Feb 2010, May 2010, ... 
    
    Hike in retail was more as compared to wholesale
        In April 2010, July 2010, Oct 2010, Dec 2010, Jan 2011, ... May- Jun 2014
        
    Wholesale and Retail Prices, both hiked in large amount    
        In Feb 2013, July 2014
        
    In July to September 2013, no news was reported, because both prices were increasing and there was a time when retail price went down but wholesale kept increasing, so this became negative slope and so was not reported. Similarly for Nov Dec 2013.
    
Retail vs Arrival:

    This method will just check check that if drop in arrival is less but hike in retail prices is high then it should be reported. This method will besically not down, change in retail with respect to change in arrival, for diffrenet windows. And if method finds that retail is changed deliberately high as compared to arrival than it will be reported.
    Such cases are reported in following tenure:
        Oct 2010, Dec 2010, May Jun 2013.
        
    In Dec 2010 and Jan 2011, arrival fell very much and prices went very high. So that tenure is also reported by our method. Some of the news aricles were also reported after sometime but during that time, arrival had started increasing and retail prices were coming down little bit so that was not reported by our method, but still prices were high so some news artcles reported that. Also, note that these aricles were mainly on Pakistan banned exports and article on inflation stating that inflation rate is high and onion prices are playing an important role in this.
    
    But this method also reports some of the false positives as well. For example, when arrival is contant at some high number but retail price is falling due to good arrival pattern, still it gets reported, because, change in retail price is higher as compared to change in arrival. Such cases are reported in,
        Feb March 2011, Jan 2014, Feb 2014
        
    This method also reports when change in arrival is high but corresponding fall in retail is less. Some of the cases related to that is as follows:
        Jul 2011, Feb March 2012, many of such cases in 2012.
    
    This method has one more limitations, like there exists some cases where arrival is increasing, but retail price is still increasing. So this will create potitive slope, where as we are looking for only negative slopes here. So such anomalies will not be reported, here. Due to this only Jan Feb 2013, Jul 2013, Nov 2013, June July 2014 news articles are not reported by this method.
    
    In Aug Sept 2013, arrival fell too much drastically, and due to that retail price went high drastically as well. And since retail prices went high too much it got reported in news articles, but this was expected, as arrival was less. And so our method did not report it.
    
    In June July 2015, there was change in arrival pattern but retail prices were constant. And because of that change in retail became zero and slope value became zero. So news article in that period did not match with our anomalies, because our system did not reported anomaly in that time period.
    
    
Wholesale vs Arrival:

    This also has cases similar to Retail vs Arrival. For example, here are the few cases where arrival dropped a bit, but wholesale price went high too much.
        Sept Oct Nov 2010, Jun 2013, Jun 2015
    In Dec 2010 and Jan 2011, we have many such cases, and also news are present for them. As stated previously also some of the news like Pak banning export are present in Jan 2011 after this tenure, those are not matched with our results.
    Constant large arrival and fall in prices is also seen for Mar 2011 and reposrted as false positives due to small change in arrival and large drop in wholesale prices.
    Some false positives, like increase in arrival and too much decrease in wholesale price like in Oct 2011, Dec 2011, Jan 2012, Jan 2014
    In Jan Feb 2013, Jul 2014, Jun 2015 along with arrival prices were also increased, but this case is not handled by this method. So news articles for that part is not covered by results of this method.
    In Nov 2013 there was increase in arrival little bit and wholesale price was coming down, so our system missed it. As prices were very much high, there were news articles present for it.
    
    
METHOD LINEAR REGRESSION:
    
    This method basically tries to find the linear relation between 2 series.
    
    Retail vs Average:
    
        This method will report any tenure as anomaly when there is large gap i.e. more than expected between retail price of a center and average price. Such tenures are reported for Dec 2010, Near to Jan 2011, May Jun Jul 2011, Jan May Jun 2012, Jun 2013
        
        Some articles near Jan 2011, Jan Feb Aug Sept Oct Nov 2013, July 2014, Jun July 2015  are not reported because there was no such large difference. Note that in the tenure of Oct Nov 2013 prices are usually high and as the prices are high tolerance level also increases little bit. So even if for some difference it is reported as anomaly at lower price, it is not necessary that for the same difference, it will be reported as anomaly at higher prices.
        
    Reatil vs Arrival:
    
        Here, in this method, it tries to predict what should be retail price based on the arrival of the poduct. So if the price is too high for the given arrival than it will be reported. Examples are Dec Jan Feb 2011, Aug Sept Oct Nov 2013, Oct Dec 2014 prices.
        
        Some of the articles in Jan Feb 2013, July 2014, June July 2015 are missed because method may have found prices to be moderate.
        
    Retail vs Wholesale:
        
        This method will report any tenure as anomaly when there is large gap i.e. more than expected between retail price of a center and wholesale price. Such tenures are reported for Feb Mar 2011, Jan 2012, June 2012, Jan Feb 2014, Apr 2015
        
        Feb 2013 news are missed because for this method price differnce might not be too much. Aug Sept Oct Nov 2013, Jun July 2015 retail and wholesale prices were both high, so its not reported.
        
    Wholesale vs Arrival:
    
        Missed articles for Jan Feb 2013, Jun Jul 2013 Jun 2015, but covered many for Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2013.
        
        
METHOD GRAPH BASED ANOMALY:

    Retail vs Average:
    
        This method sees vry successful for this particular scenario. Every tenure of anomaly has been matched with some news articles. The anomalies which were not matched with news articles were part of tenure reported and usually, this tenure is large and for every date news articles are not present. Few articles are missed that might be due to fact that we have chosen limited number of anomaly points, here 150. We look forward to increase number of these points and check what result comes.
        
    Retail vs Wholesale:
    
        The reason why any news articles is not matched is because all anomalies reported (150 chosen) are before 2010. We need to aither increase number of anomalies or pass the function series after 2009.
        
    Retail vs Wholesale:
    
        Apart from Jan 2013, July 2014, Jun 2015, anomalies are matchinng.
        
    Wholesale vs Arrival:
    
        Whole first half of 2013 is reported. This mthod is not working properly when we are taking arrival.
