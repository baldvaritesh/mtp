Few of the analysis which were local to center could not be matched with national news articles, but on digging more in regional news article, we could justify the anomaly. One of such case is the anomaly reported on 7th and 8th January 2013, for which news was reported in \href{http://www.jagran.com/news/business-onion-price-affected-from-fog-9987751.html}{Jagran local news paper} on 28th December 2012 which says due to fog there was disruption in the supply of onions. Despite of the speculation on low arrival of onion we observed considerable hike in arrival (which could be hoarded onion stocks brought into market) to earn better profits to take advantage of increased price of onion. Also, we have observed 2 news articles suspecting traders' nexus as the reason for the increased onion prices.
