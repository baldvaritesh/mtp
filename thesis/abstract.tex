Timeseries is a collection of values which characterizes behavior of some object. Analysis of timeseries can reveal various types of intrinsic properties about object. Timeseries analysis for detection of outliers can spot different interesting events or observations which are anomalous to the normal behavior of the object. These anomalous situations are often of great interest to users.
\\
This project focuses on building a general purpose library for detecting anomalies in multiple timeseries of a system.We have performed the analysis of onion supply chain system using this library. The library spotted multiple anomalous situations which were cross verified by the news articles present on onion by different news sources. The anomalies primarily in case of onion supply chain is the one caused because of artificial deficit of stocks created by traders nexus.
