\section{Analysis of Methods implemented}

The library has 5 methods to detect anomalies.
Following table describes the method and limitations of every method:

Window Correlation                    & Detects if the two timeseries follows their expected behaviour or not. i.e if the two timeseries are expected to move in tandem then it reports the tenures where they don't move in tandem and vice- versa                                                            & \begin{itemize}

So if the anomaly occurred for very small time, it won't be reported. (See Figure \ref{fig:20110106_0108})
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \item Reports results even though the fluctutaions are not very prominent. (See Figure \ref{fig:20080306_0320}) the deviation in prices were not huge but incident was reported because the two timeseries moved out of tandem.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \item Result is also dependant on selected threshold.

Slope-Based Method                    & Reports incidents when one timeseries change its value faster than other.Window correlation miss the incidents when one timeseries changes its values faster than other since it just focus on the direction of change and not on rate of change.

Linear Regression                     & It tries to build a linear model between two timeseries.

Explaination of all the cases listed in table are as following:

\begin{itemize}
 \item 27-Dec-2010 to 29-Dec-2010 : According to our hypothesis 4, price trends at different centers should behave similar. But, here retail price of onion in Mumbai took a sharp rise then faced a downfall which was not seen being followed by Delhi. Instead retail prices at Delhi continued to grow. There were multiple news articles for the same tenure which claimed traders nexus as reason for anomaly. One of the article link is given in table. (See Figure \ref{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsAvg_ill1})

  Similar is observed for 17-Oct-2013 to 27-Oct-2013. (See Figure \ref{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsAvg_ill2})

	\label{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsAvg_ill2}
	\end{figure}
\item 15-Dec-2010 to 13-Jan-2011 : There was a decrease in the arrival of onion in Mumbai at the start of December which resulted in the increase of retail price. Later arrival seemed nearly constant or increasing but prices continued to grow high. The arrival also increased when the prices were very high which could be the arrival of hoarded stock in market for profiteering.

	\end{figure}

\item 18-Nov-2013 to 24-Nov-2013 : Retail prices are decided by wholesale price. But here in Mumbai, retail price continued to remain high despite of decrease in the wholesale price. (See Figure \ref{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsWS_ill1})

	\label{fig:Delhi_RetailvsWS_ill1}
	\end{figure}

\item 17-Oct-2013 to 24-Nov-2013 : Market observed increase in the arrival on increase of wholesale in Mumbai. The supply crunch could be man-made which resulted in increase in wholesale price and then to take advantage of increased prices, stocks were released in market. (See Figure \ref{fig:Mumbai_WSvsArrival_ill1})

\end{itemize}


Few of the analysis which were local to center could not be matched with national news articles, but on digging more in regional news article, we could justify the anomaly. One of such case is the anomaly reported on 7th and 8th January 2013, in Delhi, for which news was reported in \href{http://www.jagran.com/news/business-onion-price-affected-from-fog-9987751.html}{Jagran local news paper} on 28th December 2012 which says due to fog there was disruption in the supply of onions. Despite of the speculation on low arrival of onion we observed considerable hike in arrival (which could be hoarded onion stocks brought into market) to earn better profits to take advantage of increased price of onion. Also, we have observed 2 news articles suspecting traders' nexus as the reason for the increased onion prices.
