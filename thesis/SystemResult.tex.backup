\section{Results and Findings}



The analysis was performed for differnet timeseries of two centers- Delhi and Mumbai.

Following analysis is for Mumbai. In case of Mumbai, there are total of 66 distinct days for which news articles exist. Here, articles not matched represents unique dates for which articles were present but system failed to report anomaly against that date.

Following are the inferences from the above table:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Analysis involving arrival timeseries tends to produce better matches. This could be because arrival is one of the determining factor for the price of commodity. Also, news often compare arrival data to explain the suspicous scenarios.
 \item Retail vs Average Retail does not produce good matches which shows that the prices at differnet centers tend to go in tendum which might be because of strong traders nexus.
 \item Retail vs Wholesale is not performing good results which gives a clear indication that usually retail prices align with the wholesale prices. So, retailers don't tend to get involved in the fixing of prices because they are forced to align the price of commodity with the wholesale prices.
 \item This also indirectly indicates that the most of the problem exists at the wholesale level where traders operate who are usually accused by the news reports for manipulating the price of commodity.
\end{itemize}



Following figures are the pictorical representation of the above results on timeline.

\textbf{Note:} In following figures, Yellow highlighted regions are system reported anomalies for which no corresponding news article was present, Violet highlighted region represents news article for which our system did not report any anomaly and Red highlighted region represents anomalies reported by system for which news articles were present.

Explaination of all the cases listed in table are as following:

\begin{itemize}
 \item 27-Dec-2010 to 29-Dec-2010 : According to our hypothesis 4, price trends at differnet centers should behave similar. But, here retail price of onion took a sharp rise then faced a downfall which was not seen being followed by Delhi. Instead retail prices at Delhi continued to grow. (See Figure \ref{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsAvg_ill1})

	\label{fig:Mumbai_RetailvsAvg_ill1}
	\end{figure}
 \item 
\end{itemize}


Few of the analysis which were local to center could not be matched with national news articles, but on digging more in regional news article, we could justify the anomaly. One of such case is the anomaly reported on 7th and 8th January 2013, in Delhi, for which news was reported in \href{http://www.jagran.com/news/business-onion-price-affected-from-fog-9987751.html}{Jagran local news paper} on 28th December 2012 which says due to fog there was disruption in the supply of onions. Despite of the speculation on low arrival of onion we observed considerable hike in arrival (which could be hoarded onion stocks brought into market) to earn better profits to take advantage of increased price of onion. Also, we have observed 2 news articles suspecting traders' nexus as the reason for the increased onion prices.
