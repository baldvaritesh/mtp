\chapter{Slope Based Detection}

\section{Introduction}

The method works on two time-series. It finds the ratio of steepness 
at two different points in the time-series. Let's say we have two 
time series as series1 and series2. So, in this method, we first find 
the rate of change in the time-series values for both time-series followed 
by taking ratio of these rate of change. i.e  suppose we have two points on 
time-series 1 as $y_{11}$ and $y_{12}$ and on time-series 2 as $y_{21}$ and $y_{22}$. 
Rate of change between these points is calculated as following
 $$S_1=\frac{y_{12}-y_{11}}{y_{11}}$$
 ,
  $$S_2=\frac{y_{22}-y_{21}}{y_{21}}$$
 Ratio of steepness is calculated as
 $$rs = \frac{S_1}{S_2}$$

The \textbf{rs} is calulated between first and last point of every window of
size ``w'' provided as input. 

Now, we have rate of change in the steepness(\textbf{rs}) for every window. 
The outliers are detected by the threshold value provided by user or if not, 
then threshold is computed using MAD test.

If the two time-series are expected to move in tandem, then all the points 
with \textbf{rs} greater than threshold are reported whereas if the two time 
series should not move in tandem then all the points with \textbf{rs} less than 
threshold are reported. 

\section{Related Functions}

\subsection{slopeBasedDetection(series1,smoothed1,series2,smoothed2,next{\_}val{\_}to{\_}consider, default{\_}threshold, threshold, what{\_}to{\_}consider)}

This function smoothes the provided time series data using exponential moving average(if needed) and 
calculates \textbf{rs} for first and last point of every window of size next{\_}val{\_}to{\_}consider.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Input Parameters
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item series1 \textit{(list)} : Input series 1 as a list of float values
  \item smoothed1 \textit{(boolean)} : Whether series1 is smoothed or not? If not smoothing will be done
  \item series2 \textit{(list)} : Input series 2 as a list of float values
  \item smoothed2 \textit{(boolean)} : Whether series2 is smoothed or not? If not smoothing will be done
  \item next{\_}val{\_}to{\_}consider \textit{(int)} : indicates the size of window or next point in time-series to calculate slope of steepness. Default is 7 days.
  \item default{\_}threshold \textit{(int)} : Whether to consider default threshold or not. If false, the threshold is calculated using MAD Test.
  \item threshold \textit{(int)} : Threshold value to consider if default threshold is set to true
  \item what{\_}to{\_}consider \textit{(int)} : Can be either 1,0 or -1. If the series are supposed to move in tandem 1 is set otherwise -1 is set. In case we don't know the correlation between two, 0 is set.
  \end{enumerate}

 \item Output \textit{(list)} : \\
  Returns list of tuples of the form \\
  \center{(first,second,slope\_value)}\\
  \begin{flushleft}
 where first and second are the array index of passed series
 \end{flushleft}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{anomalyDatesSlopeBaseddetetion(slopeBasedResult,any\_series)}

This function basically takes result of ”slopeBasedDetection” as input along with
any series which is list of tuples of the form (date, value), and gives date to each
anomaly.\\
The result returned by ”slopeBasedDetection” function just provides index of
data point, which is reported as anomaly. But we have time series, so we need
to provide date, instead of index of data point. So, this function basically,
attaches each anomaly with its date and returns it.\\

\begin{itemize}
 \item Input Parameters
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item slopeBasedResult \textit{(list)} : This is list of anomalies reported by ”slopeBasedDetection” function.
  \item any\_series \textit{(list)} : Any list/series of tuples in the format (Date,Value), date will be used from this series to find date against each anomaly.
 \end{enumerate}

 \item Output \textit{(list)} : \\
 	Returns list of tuples of the following form: \\ 
 	(start\_date,end\_date,slope\_value)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{correlationAtLag(series1, series2, lag, window\_size)}

This function fisrt aligns two series by given lag. If lag is positive than it 
shifts start of series2 else start of series1. After aligning both the series 
according to lag, this function calculates correlation between both series at 
all windows. 

window\_size states size of the window. So, we will start with first window 
taking first window\_size elements from each series and will calculate 
correlation. We will save this correlation value in list and will slide to next 
window. Next window will start after window\_size elements. In such a way, we 
calculate, correlation at all windows and return the list of correlation values.


\begin{itemize}
 \item Input Parameters
 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item series1 \textit{(list)} : Input series 1 as a list of float values
  \item series2 \textit{(list)} : Input series 2 as a list of float values
  \item lag \textit{(int)} : lag at which
  \item pos \textit{(int)} : To consider positive lag or not, i.e. 1 to maxlag
  \item neg \textit{(int)} : To consider negative lag or not, i.e. -maxlag to -1
 \end{enumerate}

 \item Output \textit{(list)} : \\
  Returns list of tuples of the form \\
  \center{(lag, correlation value at this lag)}
 
\end{itemize}
